      <h1>if...else and else if statements</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        The if statements you've coded so far have been all-or-nothing. If the
        condition tested <br />
        true, something happened. If the condition tested false, nothing
        happened. <br />
        <br />
        1 var x = prompt("Where does the Pope live?"); <br />
        2 if (x === "Vatican") { <br />
        3 alert("Correct!"); <br />
        4 } <br />
        <br />
        Quite often, you want something to happen either way. For example:
        <br />
        <br />
        1 var x = prompt("Where does the Pope live?"); <br />
        2 if (x === "Vatican") { <br />
        3 alert("Correct!"); <br />
        4 } <br />
        5 if (x !== "Vatican") { <br />
        6 alert("Wrong answer"); <br />
        7 } <br />
        <br />
        In this example, we have two if statements, one testing for "Vatican,"
        and another testing <br />
        for not-"Vatican". So all cases are covered, with one alert or another
        displaying, depending on <br />
        what the user has entered. <br />
        The code works, but it's more verbose than necessary. The following code
        is more <br />
        concise and, as a bonus, more readable. <br />
        <br />
        1 if (x === "Vatican") { <br />
        2 alert("Correct!"); <br />
        3 } <br />
        4 else { <br />
        5 alert("Wrong answer"); <br />
        6 } <br />
        <br />
        In the style convention I follow, the else part has exactly the same
        formatting as the if part. <br />
        As in the if part, any number of statements can execute within the else
        part. <br />
        <br />
        1 var correctAnswer = "Vatican"; <br />
        2 if (x === correctAnswer) { <br />
        3 alert("Correct!"); <br />
        4 } <br />
        5 else { <br />
        6 score--; <br />
        7 userIQ = "problematic"; <br />
        8 alert("Incorrect"); <br />
        9 } <br />
        <br />
        else if is used if all tests above have failed and you want to test
        another condition. <br />
        <br />
        1 var correctAnswer = "Vatican"; <br />
        2 if (x === correctAnswer) { <br />
        3 alert("Correct!"); <br />
        4 } <br />
        5 else if (x === "Rome") { <br />
        6 alert("Incorrect but close"); <br />
        7 } <br />
        8 else { <br />
        9 alert("Incorrect"); <br />
        10 } <br />
        <br />
        In a series of if tests, JavaScript stops testing whenever a condition
        tests true. <br />
      </p>

    <div class="moiz">
      <h1>Testing sets of conditions</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        Using the if statement, you've learned to test for a condition. If the
        condition is met, one or <br />
        more statements execute. But suppose not one but two conditions have to
        be met in order for a <br />
        test to succeed. <br />
        For example, if a guy weighs more than 300 pounds, he's just a great big
        guy. But if he <br />
        weighs more than 300 pounds and runs 40 yards in under 6 seconds? You're
        going to invite <br />
        him to try out for the NLF as a lineman. You can test for a combination
        of conditions in <br />
        JavaScript by using... <br />
        && <br />
        Here's the code. <br />
        <br />
        1 if (weight > 300 && time < 6) { <br />
        2 alert("Come to our tryout!"); <br />
        3 } <br />
        4 else { <br />
        5 alert("Come to our cookout!"); <br />
        6 } <br />
        <br />
        You can chain any number of conditions together. <br />
        <br />
        1 if (weight > 300 && time < 6 && age > 17 && gender === "male") {
        <br />
        2 alert("Come to our tryout!"); <br />
        3 } <br />
        4 else { <br />
        5 alert("Come to our cookout!"); <br />
        6 } <br />
        <br />
        You can also test for any of a set of conditions. This is the operator.
        <br />
        || <br />
        Here's an example. <br />
        <br />
        1 if (SAT > avg || GPA > 2.5 || sport === "football") { <br />
        2 alert("Welcome to Bubba State!"); <br />
        3 } <br />
        4 else { <br />
        5 alert("Have you looked into appliance repair?"); <br />
        6 } <br />
        <br />
        If in line 1 any or all of the conditions are true, the first alert
        displays. If none of them are <br />
        true (line 4), the second alert displays. <br />
        You can combine any number of and and or conditions. When you do, you
        create <br />
        ambiguities. Take this line... <br />
        <br />
        if (age > 65 || age < 21 && res === "U.S.") { <br />
        <br />
        This can be read in either of two ways. <br />
        The first way it can be read: If the person is over 65 or under 21 and,
        in addition to either <br />
        of these conditions, is also a resident of the U.S. Under this
        interpretation, both columns <br />
        need to be true in the following table to qualify as a pass. <br />
        The second way it can be read: If the person is over 65 and living
        anywhere or is under <br />
        <br />
        21 and a resident of the U.S. Under this interpretation, if either
        column in the following <br />
        table is true, it's a pass. <br />
        It's the same problem you face when you combine mathematical
        expressions. And you <br />
        solve it the same way: with parentheses. <br />
        In the following code, if the subject is over 65 and a U.S. resident,
        it's a pass. Or, if the <br />
        subject is under 21 and a U.S. resident, it's a pass. <br />
        <br />
        if ((age > 65 || age < 21) && res === "U.S.") { <br />
        <br />
        In the following code, if the subject is over 65 and living anywhere,
        it's a pass. Or, if the <br />
        subject is under 21 and living in the U.S., it's a pass. <br />
        <br />
        if (age > 65 || (age < 21 && res === "U.S.")) { <br />
